- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?

It was confusing at first; to be honest, I'm still not sure if I did it correctly, but I can definitely see how important it is through this assignment and I do understand why we need to learn it. I think it's also helpful because you can take things from other classes and reuse them, instead of having to recreate and rewrite things. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Again, I would advise myself to start the assignment earlier so I don't have to spend hours working on it at a time, but alas, I am a procrastinator. I did think this one went more smoothly than the other assignments now that we are a little bit more experienced in Java. The code from class is IMMENSELY helpful; I definitely wouldn't have been able to do this assignment without that help. I also got some help from my friend Anna-Lee Thompson on some conditional statements within my for loops and also how to test my code using main, and finally, how to add cars to the cars_attached ArrayList. At times I got very, very frustrated, but those moments were brief and I think I was generally more calmer throughout working on this assignment than the previous coding assignments, which also helped.
